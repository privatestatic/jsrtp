/**
 * SrtpCryptoContext class is the core class of SRTP implementation. There can
 * be multiple SRTP sources in one SRTP session. And each SRTP stream has a
 * corresponding SrtpCryptoContext object, identified by SSRC. In this way,
 * different sources can be protected independently.
 *
 * SrtpCryptoContext class acts as a manager class and maintains all the
 * information used in SRTP transformation. It is responsible for deriving
 * encryption/salting/authentication keys from master keys. And it will invoke
 * certain class to encrypt/decrypt (transform/reverse transform) RTP packets.
 * It will hold a replay check db and do replay check against incoming packets.
 *
 * Refer to section 3.2 in RFC3711 for detailed description of cryptographic
 * context.
 *
 * Cryptographic related parameters, i.e. encryption mode / authentication mode,
 * master encryption key and master salt key are determined outside the scope of
 * SRTP implementation. They can be assigned manually, or can be assigned
 * automatically using some key management protocol, such as MIKEY (RFC3830),
 * SDES (RFC4568) or Phil Zimmermann's ZRTP protocol (RFC6189).
